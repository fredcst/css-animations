        <h2>About FedecaM<span class="copyright">©</span></h2> 
        <p>FedecaM is a tutorial website created by students for students. Our goal is to provide an easy-to-follow tutorial on the topic of CSS animations. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn the basics of CSS animations or an experienced learner seeking for inspiration, this website is tailored for you.</p>
        <p>FedecaM was largely inspired to follow the trend of Ultimate Simplification. Minimalistic, sleek, and presenting a tiny amount of text content. The idea behind ultra-minimalism is to create a sense of levity, whilst focusing the user’s attention on what is truly required.</p>
        <p>Why use CSS animation? While static websites can be informative, they often lack interactivity and visual interest. By incorporating CSS animation, we can add dynamic visual effects and motion to our web pages, creating a unique and engaging user experience that sets us apart from the competition.</p>
        <p>This tutorial for horizontal CSS animations is designed to be easy to follow while still providing a lot of value. Walk through each step of the process to create advanced transitions.</p>
